# AI NPC Arena (Non-VR Prototype)

**Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Status:** Planning Stage  

## Overview
This project is the **non-VR prototype** for the future VR AI NPC combat game.  
The goal is to create an arena-style experience where enemies use **dynamic AI behavior** to fight and interact with the player, instead of following scripted patterns.

The final version will integrate into the VR game, but this phase focuses on:
- Building the **AI logic**
- Testing combat mechanics
- Creating real-time NPC conversations

---

## Goals for This Stage
1. **Enemy AI Combat**
   - Pathfinding and navigation
   - Dynamic difficulty scaling
   - Decision-making based on player behavior

2. **NPC Conversations**
   - Real-time AI dialogue (ElevenLabs / GPT integration)
   - Context awareness (remember past interactions)
   - Branching conversation logic

3. **Arena Setup**
   - Simple flat arena for testing
   - Basic lighting and environment assets
   - Modular layout for quick map changes

4. **Core Mechanics**
   - Player movement and combat (mouse/keyboard)
   - Basic health, stamina, and damage systems
   - Enemy spawn system

---

## Technology Stack
- **Game Engine:** Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprint + C++)
- **AI Dialogue:** OpenAI API + ElevenLabs for speech
- **Pathfinding:** Unreal NavMesh
- **Animations:** Mixamo or Unreal Marketplace assets
- **Version Control:** GitHub
