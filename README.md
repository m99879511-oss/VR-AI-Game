# VR-AI-Game
A cutting-edge VR experience where enemies are powered by advanced AI — they fight dynamically, adapt to the player’s tactics, and can hold real-time conversations.

## 🎯 Project Vision
Most games use predictable scripted enemies.  
This project aims to create **truly intelligent NPCs** that:
- Learn and adapt to player behavior
- Coordinate with each other
- Speak naturally using AI-powered voices
- Provide unique encounters every playthrough

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Unreal Engine 5** — VR development
- **Custom AI models** — Enemy behavior & decision-making
- **ElevenLabs TTS** — Real-time voice generation
- **Python** — AI logic & integration
- **RTX 5090** — Heavy AI model training

## 📂 Repository Structure

## 🚀 Goals
- Build a functional VR prototype
- Demonstrate adaptive combat AI
- Integrate natural language interaction
- Release a playable vertical slice

## 🤝 Contributing
