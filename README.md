# VR-AI-Game
A cutting-edge VR experience where enemies are powered by advanced AI — they fight dynamically, adapt to the player’s tactics, and can hold real-time conversations.
## 🚀 Quick Start - Setting Up AI

To get your PC ready to run the AI components:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/m99879511-oss/VR-AI-Game.git
cd VR-AI-Game

# 2. Run the automated setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# 3. Activate the environment  
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Test the setup
python src/main.py
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/AI_SETUP.md](docs/AI_SETUP.md).

## 🎯 Project Vision
Most games use predictable scripted enemies.  
This project aims to create **truly intelligent NPCs** that:
- Learn and adapt to player behavior
- Coordinate with each other
- Speak naturally using AI-powered voices
- Provide unique encounters every playthrough

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Unreal Engine 5** — VR development
- **Custom AI models** — Enemy behavior & decision-making
- **ElevenLabs TTS** — Real-time voice generation
- **Python** — AI logic & integration
- **RTX 5090** — Heavy AI model training
